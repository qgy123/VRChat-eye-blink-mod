# VRChat-eye-blink-mod
Real eye blink tracking mod for vive pro eye, USE IT AS YOUR OWN RISK, YOU KNOW WHY!

# How to use
Ah, wait for lazy yueluo update this readme oneday, so if you have ability to read the code, you should find out how to use it, the function I hooked into was inside the HandGestureController.Update(), if you looked into this function, your will know how to find it, there are 5 same functions, but when using index controller, only first one is invoked.

# Todo
implement a simple way to find the function offset after a game update, and we need another way to inject the game to keep yourself safe.
